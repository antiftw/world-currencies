## About

While trying to setup a module that required handling of currency codes, but had trouble finding a complete up-to-date list that was also easily downloadable without having to get an account or pay somewhere. So I decided to roll my own. For now its just 3 datapoints (name, code and symbol), but if there's a good use case for other fields they can always be added in the future.

## Contributing

Since things will inadvertedly change - likely without me noticing because it's a currency I do not use on a daily basis - feel free to create Pull Requests and I will make sure to merge them asap.
